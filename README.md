Machine Problem 2 in Computer Science 125: Operating Systems

# Processor Management and Job Scheduling

Implement the FCFS, SJF, SRPT, Priority and Round-robin scheduling. Sample data is in txt file.
- For FCFS and SJF, assume all processes arrived at time 0 in that order.
- For SRPT, consider the arrival time of each processes.
- For Priority, assume that lower-value priorities have higher priorities (that means 0 is the highest priority).
- For round-robin scheduling, assume a uniform time slice of 4 millisecond.

Display the waiting time for each process for every algorithm, as well as their average computing time.
Also, perform an algorithm evaluation, based on the datasets given to you.
